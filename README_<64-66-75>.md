**At first we created the two services.
**Then in the product service we created the index.js file which connected the localhost with the service.
**Next we created the structure of the service by dividing src folder into controllers, models and routes. 
**The models contained the model of the database.
**The routes contained the api requests.
**And the controllers had the functions to POST, PUT, DELETE AND CREATE the products.
**We then connected this service with the mysql server.
**For the rating service, we created the index.js file.
**Then in the rating.js file we wrote the functions of the code.
**In the rate config file we added the firebase configuration to connect with the firebase database.
**Throughout the process we used the Postman to check the requests.
